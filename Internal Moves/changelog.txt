ON THE VIEW PAGE:
//1. Not sure of need for “effective move date” and “actual move date”.  I would think “effective move date” is good enough.
//2. I think columns “Current Location” and “Destination” could be moved to the next level down viewable from VIEW or EDIT level.
//3. Details of “Type of Internal Change” should also be expanded upon in the VIEW or EDIT level.  This would mean that you only need a few selections under “Type of Internal Change” since details would be spelled out in next level down.
//4. Need a “Next Review Date” entry.  This will be the next time the record should be examined for change in status.




If you can, please add another check box for Cyber.  Please add an N\A box, because only some people have privileged tokens.
Can you also add the N\A check box to the Civilian\Military and Contractor Cyber pages.
